The user is requesting me to create a data visualization for a set of user information from a JSON file. The data contains various details about users such as name, IP address, age, location, etc. I need to present this data in a mobile-friendly way directly in the index.html file, without using any backend processing since everything should happen client-side.

Let's break down what I need to do:
* Parse and display the data from the provided JSON URL: https://users-data.diarcourse.workers.dev/
* Create a responsive UI that works well on mobile devices
* Display the main fields requested:
    * Day and timestamp
    * Name
    * WhatsApp
    * Email
    * Age
    * IP
    * ISP
    * Screen
    * Location (cityA, cityB, region, country)
* Include a "Details" button that reveals additional information:
* Language
* Hostname
* Postal
* Field
* Status
* Local Time

I'll use modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques to create a clean, professional interface with good mobile responsiveness. I'll make sure to use a CDN for all resources to keep everything static.

For the design, I'll aim for an Apple-like aesthetic with clean lines, appropriate white space, and subtle animations. I'll ensure all text has sufficient contrast against backgrounds, and use a consistent 8px spacing system.

Let me create a solution that meets all these requirements.
