The user is asking me to create a dashboard to display user data that's available from the URL: https://users-data.diarcourse.workers.dev/. The data seems to contain information about various users including their names, IP addresses, ages, locations, contact information, and more.

The user wants me to use CDN-hosted libraries (Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js) without any backend configuration. This means I'll need to:
* Use CDN links for Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js
* Fetch the data from the provided URL
* Display the data in a nicely formatted dashboard
* Make it responsive and visually appealing

Let's approach this by:
* Adding the necessary CDN links for Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js
* Creating the HTML structure for the dashboard
* Adding JavaScript to fetch and display the data
* Styling the dashboard with Tailwind CSS
* Adding Alpine.js functionality for interactivity

I'll break this down into multiple files to keep it organized and maintainable:
* index.html - Main HTML file with CDN links and basic structure
* components/header.js - Header component with title and search functionality
* components/userTable.js - Component to display user data in a table
* components/userCard.js - Component to display user data in card format for mobile
* components/filters.js - Component for filtering data
* utils/dataFetcher.js - Utility to fetch data from the API
* utils/dataProcessor.js - Utility to process and filter data
* styles/custom.css - Any custom styles not covered by Tailwind

Let me start building this solution.
